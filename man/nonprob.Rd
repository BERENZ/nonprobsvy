\arguments{
\item{selection}{- `formula`, the selection (propensity) equation.}

\item{outcome}{- `formula`, the outcome equation.}

\item{data}{- an optional `data.frame` with data from the nonprobability sample.}

\item{svydesign}{- an optional `svydesign` object (from the survey package) containing probability sample.}

\item{pop.totals}{- an optional `named vector` with population totals.}

\item{pop.means}{- an optional `named vector` with population means.}

\item{family.selection}{- a `character` string describing the error distribution and link function to be used in the model. Default is "binomial". Currently only binomial with logit link is supported.}

\item{family.outcome}{- a `character` string describing the error distribution and link function to be used in the model. Default is "gaussian". Currently supports: gaussian with identity link, poisson and binomial.}

\item{subset}{- an optional `vector` specifying a subset of observations to be used in the fitting process.}

\item{weights}{- an optional `vector` of ‘prior weights’ to be used in the fitting process. Should be NULL or a numeric vector. It is assumed that this vector contains frequency or analytic weights}

\item{na.action}{- a function which indicates what should happen when the data contain `NAs`.}

\item{start}{- an optional `list` with starting values for the parameters of the selection and outcome equation}

\item{verbose}{- verbose, numeric}
