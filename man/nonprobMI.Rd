nonprobMI: Function for inference based on nonprobability surveys using mass imputation}
\usage{
nonprobMI(
  outcome,
  data,
  svydesign,
  family.outcome = "gaussian",
  subset,
  weights,
  na.action,
  control.outcome = outControl(),
  control.inference = infControl(),
  start = NULL,
  verbose = 0L,
  contrasts = NULL,
  model = TRUE,
  x = TRUE,
  y = TRUE,
  ...
)
}
\arguments{
\item{outcome}{- `formula`, the outcome equation.}

\item{data}{- an optional `data.frame` with data from the nonprobability sample.}

\item{svydesign}{- an optional `svydesign` object (from the survey package) containing probability sample.}

\item{family.outcome}{- a `character` string describing the error distribution and link function to be used in the model. Default is "gaussian". Currently supports: gaussian with identity link, poisson and binomial.}

\item{subset}{- an optional `vector` specifying a subset of observations to be used in the fitting process.}

\item{weights}{- an optional `vector` of ‘prior weights’ to be used in the fitting process. Should be NULL or a numeric vector. It is assumed that this vector contains frequency or analytic weights}

\item{selection}{- `formula`, the selection (propensity) equation.}
