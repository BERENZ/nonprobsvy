nonprobIPW: Function for inference based on nonprobability big data sample and estimated propensity scores.}
\usage{
nonprobIPW(
  selection,
  data,
  svydesign,
  pop_totals,
  pop_means,
  pop_size = NULL,
  method_selection,
  family_selection = "binomial",

)
}
\arguments{
\item{selection}{- `formula`, the selection (propensity) equation.}

\item{data}{- an optional `data.frame` with data from the nonprobability sample.}

\item{svydesign}{- an optional `svydesign` object (from the survey package) containing probability sample.}

\item{pop_totals}{- an optional `named vector` with population totals.}

\item{pop_means}{- an optional `named vector` with population means.}

\item{pop_size}{- an optional `double` with population size.}

\item{method_selection}{- a `character` with method for propensity scores estimation}

\item{family_selection}{- a `character` string describing the error distribution and link function to be used in the model. Default is "binomial". Currently only binomial with logit link is supported.}

\item{subset}{- an optional `vector` specifying a subset of observations to be used in the fitting process.}

\item{weights}{- an optional `vector` of ‘prior weights’ to be used in the fitting process. Should be NULL or a numeric vector. It is assumed that this vector contains frequency or analytic weights}

\item{na_action}{a function which indicates what should happen when the data contain `NAs`.}

\item{control_selection}{a list indicating parameters to use in fitting selection model for propensity scores}

\item{control_inference}{a list indicating parameters to use in inference based on probablity and nonprobability samples, contains parameters such as estimation method or variance method}

\item{start}{- an optional `list` with starting values for the parameters of the selection and outcome equation}

\item{verbose}{- verbose, numeric}

\item{contrasts}{a}

\item{model}{a}

\item{x}{a}

\item{y}{a}

\item{...}{a}
